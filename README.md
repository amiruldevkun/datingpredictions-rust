# datingpredictions-rust
This is the same as [this repository](https://github.com/amiruldevkun/Dating-Prediction) that I have, but this one is using the Rust Programming Language.

## "Why do it in a different language when the other one is not even finished?"
Well for me I have a bad procasination habit that im still trying to break and I still dont know how to get out of this purgatory. And I also have a high curiosity level so I will always want to check out other languages too.

## Concept
It has the same concept as the repository that I linked above. It goes like this,

First, the code will try and determine your gender. Then, once it knows your gender it will assign the other gender to be the crush's gender

Secondly, it will take your age name and personality, the same goes for the crush.

Lastly, it will try to match you together, by taking personality and age into consideration.

# How-to
Well... Since I just recently started this repository, I dont know that much about about how to compile rust program. If I got it to be the same as my C# equivalent, then I'll update this readme to include a how-to for compiling.
